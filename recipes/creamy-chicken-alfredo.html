    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>12 oz fettuccine pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional, for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions, then drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for 6-7 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet, slice into strips, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the heavy cream to the skillet, stirring to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to cook for another 2 minutes until the sauce becomes smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li>Combine the cooked fettuccine pasta and sliced chicken with the Alfredo sauce. Toss everything together until well coated. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
