    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb (450g) beef sirloin, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
        <li>1 cup broccoli florets</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        <li>1 carrot, julienned</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch (optional, for thickening)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, marinate the beef with 1 tablespoon soy sauce and 1 teaspoon cornstarch. Let it sit for 15–20 minutes to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the marinated beef to the pan and stir-fry for 2–3 minutes until browned. Once cooked, remove the beef and set it aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the pan. Sauté the minced garlic and grated ginger until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the broccoli florets, sliced bell pepper, and julienned carrot to the pan. Stir-fry for 3–4 minutes until the vegetables are just tender but still crisp.</li>
        <li>Return the beef to the pan and add the remaining soy sauce and oyster sauce. Toss everything together to coat the beef and vegetables in the sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve the stir fry hot over steamed rice or noodles, and enjoy a colorful and flavorful dish!</li>
